## Measuring time spent in labels

**Note**: The discussions API currently doesn't support the `LabeledEvent` so this action cannot measure the time spent in a label for discussions.

Sometimes it is helpful to know how long an issue or pull request spent in a particular label. This action can be configured to measure the time spent in a label. This is different from only wanting to measure issues with a specific label. If that is what you want, see the section on [configuring your search query](https://github.com/github/issue-metrics/blob/main/README.md#search_query-issues-or-pull-requests-open-or-closed).

Here is an example workflow that does this:

```yaml
name: Monthly issue metrics
on:
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  issues: write
  pull-requests: read

jobs:
  build:
    name: issue metrics
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:

    - name: Run issue-metrics tool
      uses: github/issue-metrics@v2
      env:
        GH_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        LABELS_TO_MEASURE: 'waiting-for-manager-approval,waiting-for-security-review'
        SEARCH_QUERY: 'repo:owner/repo is:issue created:2023-05-01..2023-05-31 -reason:"not planned"'

    - name: Create issue
      uses: peter-evans/create-issue-from-file@v4
      with:
        title: Monthly issue metrics report
        token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
        content-filepath: ./issue_metrics.md
        assignees: <YOUR_GITHUB_HANDLE_HERE>

```

then the report will look like this:

```markdown
# Issue Metrics
